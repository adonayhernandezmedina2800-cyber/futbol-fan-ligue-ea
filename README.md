# Fútbol Fan Ligue EA - Web Inspired by Football

**Inspiration:**  
[https://dribbble.com/shots/25052365-Football-Social-Betting-App-Concept]

**Description:**  
Responsive web project developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a football image gallery, statistics, and hover effects. I took as an example the Dribbble page, where they do it for the Premier League, and I took the idea to do it for the Spanish league.

**Technologies:**  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- Font Awesome (only for icons)

**HTML Validation:**  
The project's HTML structure complies with W3C standards.
Validation was performed using the official W3C Validator, and the code passed with zero errors.
